# What is this project?

This is an example of a batch Extract Transform and Load (ETL) process to showcase my personal projects.
This code extract information from csv, json and xml file formats. This information is put together in a single file, transformations are made according to what is desired, and then loaded into a final file. The entire process is tracked via logs file.
